# CDM / Classroom Dark Mode
A stylish, minimalist dark theme for **Google Classroom**.

## Installation:

1. Download the **Stylus** browser extension.

2. Go to this link [CMD Style](https://userstyles.world/api/style/25373.user.css) and click **Install style**.

3. Done! You can now use it.

## Update v4.3.5!

What's new?

1. Updated the left sidebar with elements. The sidebar will no longer shift sideways when in the hidden state.

2. Improved site responsiveness for different screen sizes.

3. The script has been optimized — most comments were removed.

4. Fixed visual artifacts.

5. Added and updated some colors.

6. Mini-fixes.

My style will be updated until June 1, 2026. What happens after that will be decided later :)
